## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
(gap_asia_2007 <- gapminder %>% 
   filter(year == 2007, continent == "Asia"))
```


Exporitng data as a CSV
```{r}
write_csv(gap_asia_2007, "exported_file.csv") #saves data as a csv (comma separated values) file

```

Leaving out unnecessary path names. here::here lets us look into the specific place where the r script is working from.
```{r}
write_csv(gap_asia_2007, 
          here::here("participation", "data", "gap_asia_2007.csv")
) #avoids locking in the exact file path but uses the folder names to locate and save the object


dat <- read_csv(here::here("participation", "data", "gap_asia_2007.csv"))
dat #reading in the data and saving it to the object dat
```


Read.csv doesn't always assign the correct values to the data columns. So we can do this to assign the columns correctly.

```{r}
dat <- read_csv(
  here::here("participation", "data", "gap_asia_2007.csv"),
  col_types = cols(
    country = col_factor(),
    continent = col_factor(),
    year = col_date(format = "%Y"),
    .default = col_double() # all other columns as numeric (double)
  )
)
dat
```

Downloading in excel files from the internet is kinda tricky. Three main steps involved

```{r}
xls_url <- "http://gattonweb.uky.edu/sheather/book/docs/datasets/GreatestGivers.xls"
download.file(
  xls_url, 
  here::here("participation", "data", "some_file.xls"), 
  mode = "wb")


file_name <- basename(xls_url)
download.file(
  xls_url, 
  here::here("participation", "data", file_name), 
  mode = "wb")

dat <- read_excel(
  here::here("participation", "data", file_name)
)

```


Dowloading in data from SPSS

```{r}
clevel <- haven::read_spss(
  here::here("participation", "data", "clevel.sav"))

clevel_cleaned <-
  clevel %>% 
  mutate(language = as_factor(language),
         gender = as_factor(gender),
         isClevel = factor(isClevel, 
                           levels = c(0, 1), 
                           labels = c("No", "Yes"))
  )
print(clevel_cleaned) #cleaned the data so that values are replaced with what they represent

write_csv(
  clevel_cleaned, 
  here::here("participation", "data", "clevel_cleaned.csv")
) #saving the data into a new csv file in the same location

```

Saving Plots:

```{r}
clevel_plot <-
  clevel_cleaned %>% 
  mutate(isClevel = recode(isClevel, 
                           No = "Below C-level", 
                           Yes = "C-level"),
         gender = recode(gender,
                         Female = "Women",
                         Male = "Men")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(paste(isClevel, gender, sep = "\n"), Extraversion, color = gender)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter(height = .2) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#1b9e77", "#7570b3")) +
  ggtitle("Extraversion Stan Scores") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = 1:9)

clevel_plot



```

```{r}
dir.create(here::here("participation", "output", "figures"))
ggsave(here::here("participation", "output", "figures", "clevel_extraversion.svg"), 
       clevel_plot
)#creating and saving this plot to a specific folder

```
