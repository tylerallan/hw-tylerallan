# Welcome to My Repository!

This is the space where I store all of my documents related to
Dr. Brenton Wiernik's Programming with Data class. The homework,
projects, and assignments related to this class will be stored here.

Navigating through the repository should be easy enough. Assignments
will be labeled as the assignment type (hw or project), and will be
labeled with the date the assignment was due.

# About Me

## Tyler Allan

### Graduate Student at the University of South Florida

Hello, my name is **Tyler Allan**. I am a current graduate student at
the University of South Florida working towards a PhD in
*Industrial-Organizational Psychology*. Despite growing up in Georgia, I
lack many of the traits that are stereotypically indicative of being
from the South. Those include:

-   A Southern Accent
-   A pick-up truck
-   A love of country music
    -   *the exception to this rule is Dolly Parton music*

While most of my time is spent indoors researching personality traits
and workplace behavior, I do enjoy spending time outdoors and in nature.
Years ago I ran for a cross country team which led me to have a love for
woods and trails. One time out on the trail I even ran into a bear! We
must have done something to make it mad and it started running after my
friend and I. We got away luckily and we even got some of the encounter
on
