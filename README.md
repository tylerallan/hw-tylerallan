# Welcome to My Repository!

This is the space where I store all of my documents related to Dr. Brenton Wiernik's Programming with Data class. The homework, projects, and assignments related to this class will be stored here. 

Navigating through the repository should be easy enough. Assignments will be labeled as the assignment type (hw or project), and will be labeled with the date the assignment was due.

* Those feathers!
* The attitude!
  * Really though watch out, [fiesty](https://youtu.be/7Wa22DegTwM)
* You know they just think they're better than anyone else, and they're probably right
