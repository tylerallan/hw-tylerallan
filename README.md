# Welcome to My Repository!

This is the space where I store all of my documents related to Dr. Brenton Wiernik's Programming with Data class. The homework, projects, and assignments related to this class will be stored here. 

Navigating through the repository should be easy enough. Assignments will be labeled as the assignment type (hw or project), and will be labeled with the date the assignment was due.


#About Me
## Tyler Allan
### Graduate Student at the University of South Florida


Hello, my name is Tyler Allan. I am a current graduate student at the University of South Florida working towards a PhD in Industrial-Organizational Psychology. Despite growing up in Georgia, I lack many of the traits that are stereotypically indicative of being from the South. Those include:

* A Southern Accent
* A pick-up truck
* A love of country music
  * _the exception to this rule is Dolly Parton music_
